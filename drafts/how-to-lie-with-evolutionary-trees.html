                <p>Because evolution is largely treelike in large, multicellular animals (interesting cases of lateral gene transfer notwithstanding) the easiest way to display the history of life is in the form of a tree. Trees are great at packing a lot of information into a small space; they can represent the entire set of relationships between a group of organisms very compactly.</p>
<p>image credit: wikipedia
However, they can also be difficult to read and so a reader’s interpretation of them can be easily affected by the way in which they’re drawn. Take a look at this evolutionary tree, showing the evolutionary relationships between several different animals.</p>
<p>This is a pretty uncontroversial tree; you’d have difficulty finding any biologist who would disagree with it. On this tree, evolution moves from left to right and each horizontal branch defines a group of animals to the right of it. All the animals to the right of a given branch are more closely related to each other than they are to any of the other animals. For instance, the branch that I’ve marked with a red star defines a group that includes houseflies, horseflies and dung beetles. That branch tells us that these three animals are more closely related to each other than they are to any of the other animals in the tree.
Now if we wanted to tell a particular story with this tree, how could we change the presentation without changing what the tree actually says? One thing that we can do is remove animals from the tree. Doing this doesn’t change the relationships that are shown – it just means that some relationships are left out. Here’s the original tree with some of the animals in grey:</p>
<p>And here’s the tree we get when we leave those animals out. It’s completely in agreement with the first – but it tells a rather different story:</p>
<p>Look familiar? This is the “humans are the pinnacle of evolution” tree that’s often found in biology textbooks. Although all the relationships depicted in it are correct, by choosing to display only animals that are progressively more distant from humans we’ve set it up so that it looks like humans are the endpoint of evolution, and all other species are just steps along the way. If we want to make this point even stronger, we can redraw it using slanted lines:</p>
<p>So now we have a straight line from the origin of life to humans, with other species as mere offshoots. The ultimate misleading version of the tree has the species names arranged diagonally, so as to give the impression that other species are somehow “less evolved” than humans (by virtue of being not as far to the right).</p>
<p>Remember that this tree shows exactly the same relationships as the one we started with. To show how misleading it is, let’s go back to our original tree and pick a different set of species to show:
￼After removing the species in grey, we are left with this:</p>
<p>Which we can rearrange by moving the human down the list. This doesn’t alter the relationships, just the order in which we read the species names. The resulting tree, again, is in complete agreement with our original one, and shows a steady evolutionary progression towards houseflies!
￼
Adding in our layout tricks completes the picture:
￼</p>
<p>For comparison, here’s the human-centric tree, housefly-centric tree, and original tree side by side.</p>
