                <div class="summary"><h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This rather long post is my attempt to explain to novice programmers how hash tables work. A hash table is a data structure for storing key-value pairs and is part of the standard library of many languages. Depending on your language of choice, you might know hash tables as <strong>hashes</strong>, <strong>HashMaps</strong>, <strong>dictionaries</strong>, <strong>dicts</strong>, <strong>associative arrays</strong>, or <strong>symbol tables</strong>.Â </p>
<p>If you're already familiar with hash tables, you'll probably spot many points in this post where I have either simplified things, or avoided talking about them entirely. If you think that any of these simplifications hinder rather than help understanding, then please leave a comment or drop me an email - I have not doubt that this post could probably be improved!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<aside>
<p>*The manager of the nightclub is a programmer, hence the zero-indexed numbering :-)</p>
</aside>
<p>Imagine that you have a job as a coat check attendant at a nightclub. The set up is pretty straightforward: you have a desk and one hundred coat hooks labeled from 0 to 99*. When a customer wants to drop off their coat, you put it on the lowest-numbered empty hook and give them a ticket with that number written on it. </p>
<p><img alt="fig1" src="images/coat_1.png" /></p>
<p>When they want to pick up their coat, they give you the ticket, and you give them the coat from the corresponding hook.</p>
<p><img alt="fig1" src="images/coat_2.png" /></p>
<p>The system works nice and smoothly and allows customers to drop off and pick up their coats very efficiently. Let's say that the coat hooks are laid out in a sensible pattern that means that you can get to any given hook in two seconds. So the time it takes to drop off a coat is always two seconds - you can glance at the hooks, spot the next available one, and go directly to it. The time it takes to pick up a coat is also two seconds - the customer hands you their ticket, and you can go directly to the hook with that number.</p>
<h2>The problem with this system</h2>
<p>The only problem with this is that customers keep losing their tickets. Once somebody has lost their ticket, the whole system breaks down - the only way to reunite the customer with their coat is to get a description of it, then go hunting through all the coats currently on the rack to try to find it. Even if it only takes five seconds to compare a given coat to the customer's description, it also takes two seconds to get between hooks, for a total of seven seconds to check each coat. If all one hundred hooks are occupied, then on average you'll have to check fifty coats before you find the right one (assuming that the customer can give you an unambiguous description!), which means that it takes you three hundred and fifty seconds, or just under six minutes, to find a coat for which the customer has forgotten their ticket.</p>
<h2>The name tag system</h2>
<p>One night you decide that you've had enough - a whole bunch of customers lose their tickets, and you end up spending the whole night searching for coats that match some vague description. You decide to implement a new system: from now on, whenever you take a coat from a customer, you'll write their name down on a tag and attach it to the coat before you put it on a hook. </p>
<p><img alt="fig1" src="images/coat_3.png" /></p>
<p>Then, when a customer wants to pick up their coat, you can just ask them their name (surely they can't forget that!) and go through the coats one-at-a-time until you find the one with the correct name. </p>
<p><img alt="fig1" src="images/coat_4.png" /></p>
<p>We'll assume, for the purposes of this story, that you never get two customers with the same name.</p>
<p>How does this new process compare to the old one, speed-wise? Let's say that it takes a couple of seconds to write the customers name down, so the total time it takes to drop off a coat is four seconds. Let's also say that it takes just one second to check the name on a tag, so it takes a total of three seconds to check a given coat to see if it belongs to a particular customer (one to check the name, and two to move between hooks). On average, you'll have to check fifty coats to find the correct one, so the average time to pick up a coat is two and a half minutes. This system isn't as fast as the numbered-ticket system if the customer has their ticket, but it's much faster than the numbered-tickets system if the customer loses their ticket!</p>
<h2>The first letter system</h2>
<p>One night when you are particularly bored, you start thinking about how your system could be improved - as it stands, the numbers on the hooks are kind of useless, since they don't correspond to any useful bit of information. You realize that you can actually fit more than one coat on each hook, and you wonder whether you might be able to use that fact to your advantage. You decide to try another new system: first you get some sticky labels and a pen, and you label the first 26 hooks with the 26 letters of the alphabet. When a customer drops off their coat, you will now use the first letter of their name to decide which hook to put it on - if their name begins with A you will put it on the first hook, if it begins with B on the second, etc. You'll still attach a name tag, just like before.</p>
<p><img alt="fig1" src="images/coat_5.png" /></p>
<p>Here's where it gets interesting; when a customer comes to pick up their coat, you can now to straight to the hook which matches the first letter of their name, and start checking the coats on that hook to find the one with their name tag. </p>
<p><img alt="fig1" src="images/coat_6.png" /></p>
<p>It's likely that there will be more than one coat on the hook, but it's also likely that there will be ...</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>I teach a lot of beginner-targeted programming courses, and something that I've experimented with recently is trying to introduce the idea of self-documenting code early on in the learning process. I usually start off by talking about the difference between good and bad names for things (mostly functions and variables, though many of the same arguments apply to class names) , and I've noticed a few common patterns that tend to crop up in beginners code. I thought it might be useful to lay out these common errors in one place.</p>
<h2>Single-letter names</h2>
<p>OK, we're writing a program and we need to create a new variable, but we can't think of a good name....let's just start with `a and work our way through the alphabet. Later on we find that we have a bit of code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;acgatagc&#39;</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="s">&#39;X&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">h</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which is well on its way to becoming completely incomprehensible. Sometimes single-letter names are the result of a desire to avoid typing or a worry about running out of space in your text editor. Neither of these are good enough reasons to write code as unreadable as the example above! Rest assured that using longer, more descriptive names will not make your program slow, or make any appreciable difference to the time it takes to type a line. Here's a sane version:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">dna</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;acgatagc&#39;</span>
<span class="n">last_codon_start</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dna</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">protein</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">codon_start</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">last_codon_start</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">codon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">dna</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">codon_start</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">codon_start</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">amino_acid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">genetic_code</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">codon</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="s">&#39;X&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">protein</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">protein</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">amino_acid</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which might now be interpretable as part of a program that translates DNA sequences.</p>
<p>Sometimes we might want to use non-meaningful variable names to illustrate a very generic bit of code: for example, if we want to demonstrate how to append a value to a list:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<aside>
<p>*Delightfully, there are versions of these in many languagues - take a look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable#Words_commonly_used_as_metasyntactic_variables">here</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>but for these purposes it's better to use the well-known set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable">metasyntatic variables</a>*:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There are a couple of situations where single-letter variables do make sense; mostly where there are strong conventions for their use. For example, if we're writing a program to deal with Cartesian co-ordinates then I won't be too upset to see variables called <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> (though I might make a case for <code>x_pos</code> and <code>y_pos</code>). Similarly, <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are the traditional names for variables used as counters in a loop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">j</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c"># do something</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but remember that the most common use for these variables - to hold an index when iterating over a list - doesn't often occur in Python because we generally iterate over the elements of lists directly, in which case there's no excuse for not picking a meaningful variable name.</p>
<h2>Naming thing after their type</h2>
<p>This is a habit that people are most likely to fall into shortly after having learned of the existence of types, or shortly after having learned about a new type. The logic goes something like this: I've just been told that it's important to remember whether a variable is a string or a number, so I'll make that fact part of the name. This is not necessarily a terrible idea - in fact there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">an entire system of variable naming</a> based on it. Where it becomes a problem is when the type becomes the most important part of the name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">my_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="n">my_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;</span>
<span class="n">the_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">a_file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;foo.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scores</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is obviously problematic: it's generally much more important to know what values are stored in a variable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">minimum_name_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="n">species_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;</span>
<span class="n">reading_frames</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">input_file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;foo.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">calculate_average</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scores</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>


<aside>
<p>*See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Duck Typing</a> for more on this.</p>
</aside>
<p>There's a more subtle problem with types-as-variable-names - the dynamic nature of Python means that it tends to work best when we worry about the various ways that a variable can be used, rather than its type*. It's this magic that allows us, for example, to iterate over lists, strings and files using a single syntax.</p>
<h2>Extremely vague names</h2>
<p>Often when we create a variable, or start writing a function, we're not exactly sure what its job is going to be in our program. This is especially true when we first start writing code. Unfortunately, this can lead to some very unhelpful variable names - examples I have seen in the wild include <code>data</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>output</code>, <code>do_stuff()</code>, <code>process_files()</code>, <code>params</code>, <code>object</code>, and <code>true_or_false</code>. If you find yourself using a "placeholder" name like these during the process of coding, it's a good idea to go back and change them once you've figure out what the function or variable is actually doing.</p>
<h2>Sequential names</h2>
<p>This is a perennial problem in the world of naming, whether we are talking about Python variables or word processing files (how many people have a folder containing files with names like <em>final_draft.doc</em>, <em>final_draft2.doc</em>, <em>final_draft2.1.doc</em>, <em>final_draft2_update.doc</em>?) Thought of the perfect variable name, but then realized that you've already used it? No problem, just stick a "2" on the end of that bad boy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">word</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;albatross&#39;</span>
<span class="n">word2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">word3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">word2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Hopefully it's not necessary to point out why this can be confusing when you come back to read the code. We can rescue the above example in a couple of ways. One is to use more descriptive names:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">word</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;albatross&#39;</span>
<span class="n">uppercase_word</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">punctuated_word</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">uppercase_word</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another way is to recognize that we're probably not going to use <code>word</code> or <code>uppercase_word</code> in our program, and just do the whole thing in one step:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">final_word</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;albatross&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
